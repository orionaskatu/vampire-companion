# Vampire: The Masquerade - CHAPTERS Companion App

## Description

This is a robust companion app for Vampire: the Masquerade - CHAPTERS boardgame. It contains all enemies' and allies' cards and corresponding combat decks for them.

Features:

- set up character cards
- track down their wounds
- draw their combat cards

Supported languages:
Currently only the English version is available, although I'll gladly accept translation strings for other languages (check out `src/translations/en.json` file)

## Further development

I have only a few vague ideas for future work on this app.

1. More detailed deck management (allowing to reshuffle decks manually, add/remove specific cards etc.). I would like to double-check if it is needed
2. UI and codebase revisit. I've made a lot of weird decisions on both fronts, so I think I need to improve them at some point. Also, maybe better mobile support
3. Scenario setup - give the ability to select a scenario and the app should set up all cards automatically.
4. Afflictions tracker - give the option to add affliction tokens to characters
5. Any other further suggestions
